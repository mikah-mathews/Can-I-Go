## Name of Student: Mikah Mathews

## Name of Project: (Temporary Name: Bathroom Accessibility Ratings)

## Project's Purpose or Goal: 

  This project will allow users to rate different bathrooms and their accessibility. It's hard to find good bathrooms and being able to plan ahead for outings would make disabled lives easier.

## List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:

  Users should be able to search for business restrooms, see the bathroom ratings (both overall and individual reviews), write bathroom ratings, and have full CRUD functionality for reviews. 

## What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.

  I am not fully sure of backend technologies but I know that I will be using HTML/CSS/Bootstrap. I may be
  using MySQL for the database and react for the frontend. It is still TBD

## If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on  next? Describe these features here: Be specific.
  Add functionality for Users to be able to look up bathrooms close to them based on location/proximity, look into hosting on web. Another stretch goal is including general business accessibility, as well as shortcuts to the ADA complaints so users can easily file an ADA claim if the business or place is not in complaince with ADA regulations.    

## What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?

TBD

## Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?

Long term I would like to see this application grow and be used in conjunction with Yelp or something similar. I do not know how to make extensions for yelp yet (not even sure it's an option - need to research); but I believe that accessibility should become mainstream and easy for disabled people to plan their trips without having to worry about lack of bathrooms.
